## 🚀 About Me

Senior Software Engineering New Grad | Passionate About Quality Assurance | Seeking Full-Time Opportunities


I'm a newly graduated student from Brigham Young University - Idaho, majoring in Software Engineering with an emphasis on Quality Assurance.

Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in and created Python, C#, JavaScript, and SQL projects. I have also written CMM plans, testing reports, and risk mitigation plans. 

My work style is detail-oriented and supportive. I’m passionate about collaborative work and firmly believe that quality outcomes stem from collective efforts. I care deeply about self-development, and this need to better myself is reflected in my work. Therefore, I’m always looking for ways to improve processes and results. 

Looking ahead, I aspire to have an opportunity to contribute professionally and develop my skills and expertise as a Software Engineer.
